# Playing-XI-Generator-for-T20-Cricket-
Dynamic Role-Based Optimal Playing XI Generator for T20 Cricket using Match Context &amp; MLP Model

This repository presents a **context-aware, machine learning–driven cricket analytics system** designed to **predict player performance** and **automatically select an optimal Playing XI** under real-world match constraints.

Unlike traditional stat-based approaches, this system integrates:

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression**
- **Contextual match intelligence**
- **Role- and position-aware selection logic**
- **Reliability modeling, innings-awareness, and fielding impact**

The result is an **end-to-end decision support framework** for cricket team selection, implemented as an **interactive Streamlit application**.
